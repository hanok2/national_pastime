0. Players form mental models that represent their conceptions of themselves as players. A
    cool way to change the world is to persuade a player to alter their fundamental conception
    of themself. E.g., a player with low confidence doesn't believe they are a power hitter, but
    you convince them that they are, thereby unlocking that potential (and of course it could also
    go wrongly in the obverse).
