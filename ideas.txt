-1. Do cool stuff with the PitchInterims. Have everyone's minds wander during them; e.g., this
    is when players will decide whether or not to retire.

0. Players form mental models that represent their conceptions of themselves as players. A
    cool way to change the world is to persuade a player to alter their fundamental conception
    of themself. E.g., a player with low confidence doesn't believe they are a power hitter, but
    you convince them that they are, thereby unlocking that potential (and of course it could also
    go wrongly in the obverse).


1. Generate coats of arms procedurally; their specifications seem very operationalizable in
    Tracery or Expressionist. E.g.:
        Quarterly: 1st and 4th, or, on a fesse, dancett√©e, with plain cotises
        between three billets, sa., each charged with a lion, rampant, of the
        field, as many bezants; 2nd, gu., an eagle, displayed, barry of six,
        erminois and az.; 3rd, or, a saltier, sa., in chief, a leopard's face,
        of the second.
