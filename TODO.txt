1. People don't even meet doctors who deliver their children, lawyers, etc. Need to have those
    events occur as parts of routines. Like, that's where you're going today if you're in labor,
    etc. That way, all the social stuff that is handled as parts of routines will get handled.

2. It's kind of awkward to, e.g., have a barbershop empire in 1870. Make holding companies only form for
    certain kinds of businesses.

3. Convert PersonExNihilo to Immigrant class, and then specify which country they're coming from.
    Can then give them appropriate surname for the country and move them to appropriate city
    given their nationality.
