# ARTIFACTS ARE LIKE ITEMS IN THE SIMS, EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT COLLECTIONS OF AFFORDANCES,
# BUT OF KNOWLEDGE-TRANSFER FUNCTIONS -- E.G., WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PHOTOGRAPH, KNOWLEDGE
# JUMPS INTO YOUR MIND ABOUT ITS SUBJECTS, OR WHEN YOU LOOK AT PERSON WEARING A WEDDING
# RING, YOU LEARN THAT THEY ARE MARRIED.

# ONE THING I NEED: A METHOD OF DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE CAN RECOGNIZE WHO IS IN
# A PHOTOGRAPH GIVEN THEIR OWN MENTAL MODELS. NAIVE WAY WOULD BE TO SAY IF THEY HAVE
# A MENTAL MODEL OF SUBJECT, THEY RECOGNIZE THEM. BETTER WOULD BE TO LOOK AT FEATURE
# OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT A PHOTOGRAPH PROJECTS ABOUT THE SUBJECTS AND EVERYONE THEY
# KNOW ABOUT AND WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE RE: THE FEATURES IN QUESTION.

# WHILE YOU THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF, KEEP IN MIND PLANNED TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION
# LIKE RADIO BROADCASTS, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, OBITUARIES, ETC.

# Prescription, notice of doctors appointment, glasses (have to enforce people going to optometrist
# if they have glasses), upcoming dentist appointment (simulate dentist office bookkeeping).
